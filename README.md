# LC-QuAD-2.0-Query-Test
This project focuses on querying the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint as well as DBPedia using questions and queries from the LC-QuAD 2.0 dataset. The queries are sent to the Skynet Coypu endpoint as well DBPedia endpoint, and the responses are analyzed to determine if the queries return proper answers, no answers, or fail to execute.
